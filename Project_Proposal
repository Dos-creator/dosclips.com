    <h1>Welcome to Dos Clips!</h1>

<p>Notice!: For privacy reasons i will not be including any personal information other than a unique identifier tied to my university.</p>

    <p>This website is a project for a university unit with ownership to student and website developer/owner 35632345.</p>


<p> When thinking about what to create for a website I was inspired by my friends comments on my **terrible performance in video games**,
    especially when I made hilariously bad plays. Inspired by this, I've decided to create a space where the community can share
    their gaming fails and laugh together.</p>

    <h2>How This Website Will Work:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A dedicated email or Discord Server will be used for video submissions by the public.</li>
        <li>The Senders of the video clips will be required to sign a TOS before access to the email or discord. </li>
        <li>The Sender will have a choice of having themselves mentioned. </li>
        <li>I will manually insert new video clips every day or week, may eventually turn into a automatic system. </li>
        <li>Video Files will be removed from the website after their "time is up", rather i'll be storing them on email or discord as a way to save on costs.</li>
        <li>The "worst gaming clip of the day" will be showcased in the center of the site.</li>
        <li>I’ll be designing an **iconic** background and logo (it probably won’t be amazing, but it will be memorable!).</li>
        <li>I may be including game related ads to help cover costs of the website, this is because i do not want to charge people for using the website or sending video files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Website Goal:</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to create a **fun, interactive space** where gamers can submit their clips to the internet,
    get featured, and enjoy gaming moments—even the worst ones!</p>
